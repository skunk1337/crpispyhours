# crpispyhours
A tool for MacOS users to track time in Crispy Doom
This will automatically create a crispy_logs directory and crispy_doom_usage.log
All you need to do is run ~/crispyhours.sh in terminal
I will be releasing an updated version that launches when you log into your mac and runs quietly in the background.
